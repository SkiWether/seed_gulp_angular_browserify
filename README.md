# seed_gulp_angular_browserify

This is an experimental seed for using Gulp, AngularJS, and Browserify. My intention is to create a seed that gives 
the developer total control over their development toolbox so they can immediately start projects with their preferred tools, 
such as specific UI frameworks or JavaScript preprocessors.

I'm using a portion of the tutorial provided by Michael Herman (http://mherman.org/), along with my own modifications. The idea is to experiment with different task automation tools, as well as other tools in the front-end spectrum. In this case, I'm using Gulp.
